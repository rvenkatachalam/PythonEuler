# PythonEuler
All my Python codes for projecteuler.net! Solved the problems as a means to learn Python. Hope to solve 50% of the problems some day!

I work across both my personal Macbook and office Lenovo laptops. I solve the problems when I find time, and hence it is important I have codes saved in my github project so that I can pull it from anywhere and work. Else it becomes tedious to keep track of my codes in one place or on google drives.
